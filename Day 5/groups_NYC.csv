<p>The founding organizers of this meetup are long-time members of the Google Developer Group community.

<p><span>In March 2016, we made a collective decision to rebrand and launch """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""GDG NYC"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as the <b>official Google Developer Group New York City&nbsp;</b>chapter and look forward to working with both the Google Developer advocates and with the greater New York City developer community, to make this city a showcase for next-generation technologies.
